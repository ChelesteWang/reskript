This project has reportLintErrors option disabled in reskript.config.js,
and there is no pre-commit hook to lint your files,
you should at least install husky to enable pre-commit hook.

  npm install --save-dev husky@next

Then add this part to your package.json:

  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-commit": "skr lint --staged"
    }
  }
